## Summary

The [inspector-front-end](inspector-front-end) folder contains front-end files of the dev tools debugger. The plugin is based on the [Blink](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink) project. The actual files are taken from [master](https://github.com/ibuziuk/inspector-front-end) branch of the project, which was previously a submodule.
